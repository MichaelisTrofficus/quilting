# Image Quilting for Texture Synthesis

This is my own implementation of the **quilting algorithm** in C++ programming language using the OpenCV library.  The algorithm is pretty straight forward, but it produces good results. In the following image (which comes from the original paper), you can see, in summary, how quilting works.

In a), we can see the na√Øve approach, that is, a **random placement of blocks** coming from the input texture.

 In b), we place neighboring blocks constrained by overlap (we choose those blocks which have the **minimum quadratic error in the region of overlap**).

 In c), we apply a **mincut algorithm**, to obtain a minimum error cut in the region of overlap between neighboring blocks.

You can check the details of the implementation (I did it for educational purposes, so don't expect highest efficiency) in the source files. To conclude, I will show some interesting results.
